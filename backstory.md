# Backstory

## Early Childhood

Pööt Jabadoo Badger Gimble was born and raised in the [Warrens](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Warrens) --- a network of burrows beneath Dock Ward and Castle Ward in [Waterdeep](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Waterdeep) --- to a family of [rock gnomes](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_gnome). He has green eyes, red-brown hair, and tan skin. (THE WARRENS IS A LARGE PLACE. WOULDN'T MAGIC BE PROMINENT? )

As a young child he shared in the childishness of his parents and six older siblings. Their days were filled with tricks and games and laughter (Pööt's father is, in fact, quite renown among gnomes for the quality of his puns). Like many children, Pööt was enthralled by tales of adventure. He dreamed of wizards and sorcerers, cunning villains, and ferocious dragons. His siblings and he could always be found acting out some epic fantasy or pestering the poor local story teller another enthralling legend.

 When Pööt was in his 7th year of life, a traveling band of minstrels rode into Pööt’s village where they were to perform a two-night show! The main act of the show was “The Great Zaltar: Master of Magic". Pööt’s heart swelled with excitement. A real life wizard! This was Pööt’s chance to finally see the world he had always dreamed of. Perhaps The Great Zaltar would recognize Pööt’s heroic spirit and offer to train him in the ways of magic. The two of them could then embark on great adventures! 
 
 The first night of the performance Pööt sat glued to his seat, utterly captivated by the splendorous display of magic and wonder which took place before him; fire breathers and sword swallowers, acrobats and sharp-shooters, and of course The Great Zaltar himself. That night Pööt could barely sleep as he replayed the night’s events in his head and imagined himself up there on the stage performing magical marvels — or even better, on a mountaintop fighting a dragon side-by-side with Zaltar! 
 
 The next day, impatient and unable to contain himself, Pööt went early to the minstrel camp. Finding the temporarily erected stage empty, he set out in search of Zaltar’s wagon, hoping, perhaps, to meet the great wizard and begin their adventures together. Upon finding Zaltar’s wagon, Pööt peered between the spokes of one of the wagon’s large wheels where he saw Zaltar preparing for the nights performance. But what he saw was far from magical. Spring loaded pigeon launchers and false bottomed hats, hollowed out spell-books and rubber wands. Pööt’s rock gnome eyes instantly recognized the gizmos for what they were. Shams! Trickery! Lies. Pööt didn’t bother going to that night’s show. The poor little rock gnome’s heart was deflated.

## Adolescence

Pööt never discussed what he had discovered behind Zaltar’s wagon. But those close to him did notice a marked difference in Pööt’s behavior after the minstrel show left town. Pööt’s demeanor was notably more serious (relative to a rock gnome at least), and his interests shifted from magic and adventure to an almost single-minded obsession with math, science, logic, and engineering. 

He began to long for a more serious family. _Why wasn't I born to dwarves?_, he often thought. Pööt's studiousness and unnatural desire to travel were the talk of the town. His brothers and sisters teased him constantly. His parents were never ashamed of his strange ways, but they did not understand them anymore than the village people did. What were they to do with a son who strove to discover the deepest contents of the universe when they only wanted to discover the deepest contents of a fruit pie? Nevertheless, they encouraged Pööt to do what he wanted.

By the time Pööt was 15 he had become well known in his village as a brilliant clockwork engineer, and his former passions were forgotten. His family, friends, and neighbors all marveled at his brilliant inventions (except when they were instead terrorized by them due to a miscalculation or catastrophic malfunction... but that was generally forgiven and forgotten).

## Adulthood

Although Pööt retained much of the childish joy and enthusiasm typical of a rock gnome ---particularly when it came to learning the inner workings of machines --- those who knew him best would describe him as analytically minded and skeptical. His friends would often find him in the library late at night, reading such scholarly books as Fenwyn Greyleaf’s _A Brief History of Limes_ --- a treatise on whether limes actually cause the sensation of sourness in one’s mouth, or whether it is coincidence. They might also note that Pööt was completely dismissive of magic and was know to deridingly refer to it as “hocus pocus”. The very idea of magic seemed so wholly illogical and insensible to Pööt as an adult that he was even ashamed of his child-self, the boy who believed in Zaltar’s powers. 

Unsurprisingly, Pööt decided that he wanted to become a [Clan Craftsman](http://engl393-dnd5th.wikia.com/wiki/Clan_Crafter) and applied for admittance when he was in his early twenties. Though the dwarven Stout Folk are generally hesitant to admit other races, Pööt’s brilliance was undeniable. He impressed the Craftsmen so much with his inventions that he was taken on as an apprentice by the legendary artisan [Orsik Dankil](#orsik), author of _A Theory of Some Things_ (a book that lists objects and events in the world by order of importance and consequence. You might note that fruit pies are near the last page). Orsik's workshop was beneath the city of [Sundabar](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Sundabar), and so to there Pööt travelled, the first of his family in several generations to travel beyond [Waterdeep](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Waterdeep). 

When Pööt was in the 18th year of his apprenticeship he was working on his magnum opus — the Analytical Engine: A mechanical brain the size of an [Ogrémoch](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Ogr%C3%A9moch). Dankil cautioned his student to be careful, but Pööt insisted that his machine was going to change the world. Powering the gargantuan device, however, was going to require an immense amount of power. And so Pööt contrived devices that would harness the powers of lightning and geothermal eruptions (it is worth noting that rock gnomes are generally dubious of steam power and utterly incompetent with electricity). It was while testing these contraptions that ‘The Incident’ occurred. 

To give an idea of the magnitude of ‘The Incident’, all that remains of Pööt’s Analytical Engine is a crater, roughly 40 ft deep and roughly twice that length in diameter. Pööt was lucky to have survived it. He was not, however, unchanged. In fact, bizarre things started to happen around Pööt. For example, his papers would spontaneously set ablaze while he worked his calculations, or sparks would shoot from his fingers when he reached to shake hands with a patron. And that wasn’t even the absolute worst of it. 

The absolute worst of it was that Pööt, devout reasoner, lover of all things logical, user of cogs and gears, had been transported by the explosion of his Engine to a realm known as [_the Feywild_](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Feywild). There, Pööt encountered all kinds of magic --- things he could not explain, no matter how hard he tried. He searched the Fey for signs of trickery. He hunted for the false devices he had seen Zaltar use so many years before. He found none. 

What he did find was a friendly --- and mischievous --- [Sirine](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Sirine) named Ada. She showed Pööt all the magic she knew and he refused to believe any of it... at first. Emphatically, he begged Ada to return him to his world, where things were sensible, and to Master Dankil who must surely be worried or at least annoyed by Pööt’ absence. But Ada took Pööt’s skepticism as a challenge. She would not show him the way home until Pööt agreed that the magical powers she showed him were real. 

Despite all his reasoning, Pööt could not explain away Ada’s abilities. Eventually, he came to accept that she might have some unique power; after that, it was all too easy for Pööt to realize the error of his ways. He looked around the Fey world and saw magic everywhere. He saw fires come from fingertips and objects levitate at the flick of a hand. Of course, as soon as Pööt believed in magic, his studious nature would not allow him to simply walk away. So Ada taught him as much as she knew, and finally he was allowed to leave the [Feywild](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Feywild). 

Upon his return from the [Feywild](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Feywild), Master Dankil noticed the change in his apprentice. Pööt was still driven and he still wanted to learn all he possibly could. But his focus was no longer placed solely on his Analytical Engine or on typical Crafting. Pööt did not reveal the cause for this change to his master, as his memories from the [Feywild](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Feywild) were hazy and he was afraid Dankil would laugh at the notion of magical abilities. Master Dankil, however, was too smart to believe that nothing had happened. After he walked in on Pööt levitating a large metal brace while staring off into space, Dankil insisted that Pööt leave the apprenticeship and study the thing he was truly interested in: Magic. 

And so Pööt abandoned his Analytical Engine and set forth to fill a spellbook with as much magic as he possibly could. That is not to say that Pööt no longer cares for mechanical inventions and logic. Pööt Gimble may in fact be the first wizard to combine the two antithetical disciplines. And he still has the utmost disdain for false wizards, “magicians” and “kooks,” as he calls them. But he is at the heart of it a gnome with a burning desire to understand all things --- and magic is perhaps the greatest mystery one could aim to comprehend.

## Gear

Pööt has a pipe wrench named Piper which he takes everywhere he goes. He claims Piper has saved his life numerous times. When Pööt began to learn magic, Ada helped him attune Piper as arcane focus. Also, if you need a bolt tightened, Piper is your gal.

## Orsik Dankil

Orsik Dankil is a dwarf of clan Battlehammer and a renown craftsman and scholar. He lives in his workshop beneath [Sundabar](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Sundabar) where he has an extensive patronage. He is also the author of the influencial book _A Theory of Some Things_.

# Meta

## The Analyitical Engine

The Analyitical Engine is a reference to Charles Babbage's [mechanical computer.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine) The namesake of the sirine, Ada, is [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace).

## Clumsy Magic

Because Pööt's logical nature is often antipodal to the workings of magic, his magic occasionally misfires in mystifying ways. When casting a spell of one of his highest two levels, Pööt must roll a d20\. On a natural 20 the DM rolls a d100 to determine the outcome from the _Clumsy Magic_ table.
